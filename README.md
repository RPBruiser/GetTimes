# GetTimes
##Arduino Library for Solar Times

This is a library that allows you to access the sunset and sunrise times for the East Coats of the United States. I am currently in the process of writing a full in depth read me file, as well as allowing this to work in any time zone. You can also see if you are currently in Daylight Savings or not. I will be working on a method that would allow you to see your time zone (e.g. UTC+0001).
